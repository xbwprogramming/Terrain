# Terrain
RailgunTrader and TerrainCoin work together by creating a Blind Auction OTC-Decentralized Exchange with frequent trading windows to generate fees that accumulate in an Angel Fund treasury for other Mode Network & Optimism Super Chain DeFi Projects. 

#Protocol Overview
TerrainProtocol pioneers a decentralized financial ecosystem designed for crypto enthusiasts, innovators, and seasoned investors. Comprising three smart contracts – RailGunTrader, TerrainTreasury, and TerrainCoin – the protocol excels in facilitating discreet, anonymous bulk OTC trades and fostering angel investing within the vibrant Optimistic Superchain and Mode Network DeFi landscape.

#Interconnected Synergy

Trade Flow: Users leverage RailGunTrader for discreet, large-scale OTC trades specifically for the ETH/USDC trading pair. The Optimism Superchain Fee Sequencer is used on all cleared trades to accumulate assets in TerrainTreasury to contribute to the creation of TerrainCoin. 

Angel Investing Loop: TerrainCoin has built-in functionality for integration points with Uniswap and Sushiswap to create a TerrainCoin/USDC liquidity pool that can be maintained to earn a stakeable asset for liquidity pool holders that can only be used to stake to other Optimism Superchain and Mode Network protocols that allow them to borrow up to the total USDC amount in the liquidity pair from the TerrainTreasury contract. It is rebated back to trade participants on cleared trades over 10ETH(tied to the TerrainCoin minting mechanic) at 20% of trade fee rates for them to begin farming tokens to use for trade fees or building up the TerrainCoin/USDC liquidity pool. Eventually the Terrain Protocol team will be able to network with OP Superchain and Mode Network backers on how to best use treasury to further development on the chain from trade fees accumulated off decentralized confidential OTC-trade appetite. 

The integration of liquidity pools encourages users to stake assets and participate in the growth of other protocols.

$RailGunTrader - Discreet, Anonymous OTC Trades

Core Features:
Blind Auction Mechanism:

RailGunTrader's unique blind auction mechanic allows users to confidentially lock in bulk buy and sell orders within ten-minute trading windows. This innovative approach prevents front-running and eliminates the need for instantaneous decision-making, when you place an order it only clears if the price comes in in the matched order at the end of a 10-minute trading window. 

FIFO Trade Clearing:

The First Match First Trade (FIFO) sequence ensures that orders are executed in a fair and efficient manner. By clearing matched orders in two one-way transactions after each trading window, RailGunTrader also optimizes gas efficiency and minimizes slippage, contributing to a seamless trading experience with all orders placed in 10-minute blocks executing in two transactions to lower MEV

Enhanced Confidentiality:

RailGunTrader prioritizes user privacy by keeping order details confidential. This approach minimizes market impact, protects traders from price slippage, and maintains anonymity throughout the trading process.
Efficient Two-Step Transactions:

The execution of matched orders in two one-way transactions enhances efficiency. This process minimizes gas fees, slippage, and the risk of frontrunning, providing users with a cost-effective and secure trading environment.

Private Orderbook Insights:

Users gain visibility into matched order prices from two ten-minute trading windows ago. This feature empowers traders with historical market insights while safeguarding the confidentiality of current orders, fostering a balanced and informed trading experience. This enables the blind auction feel that cuts out negotiations into an instant reveal trade clear.

$TerrainTreasury - Asset Accumulation and Angel Investing Hub
Core Features:
Seamless Integration with RailGunTrader:

TerrainTreasury seamlessly integrates with RailGunTrader, leveraging the Optimistic Superchain Fee Sequencer to accumulate assets. This integration creates a robust ecosystem that generates and synergizes three primary assets: ETH, USDC, and the native Optimistic Superchain token "TerrainCoin."

Loan Pool Creation:

TerrainTreasury allocates half of the ETH/USDC balance to create a dynamic loan pool. This feature introduces angel investing opportunities, allowing traders to contribute to other DeFi protocols and participate in the growth of the ecosystem. The TerrainCoin/USDC liquidity pair can be staked in future OP Superchain protocols to allow those DeFi-focused protocols to access the TerrainTreasury USDC Loan Pool based off staked TerrainCoin/USDC liquidity pairs in dApp.  For protocols that integrate that functionality, they can airdrop native tokens for TerrainCoin/USDC stakers or other rewards. 

Liquidity Pool Integration:

The integration with Uniswap/Sushiswap for the TerrainCoin/USDC liquidity pool further enhances TerrainTreasury's functionality. Users can stake assets and earn rewards in various Optimistic Superchain and Mode Network protocols, promoting engagement and liquidity.
MintTerrainCoin Function:

The MintTerrainCoin function serves as a pivotal mechanism for generating TerrainCoin. Triggered when the treasury holds more than 30 ETH, it mints 1,000 TerrainCoin for every additional 1 ETH, fostering a scalable and sustainable token generation process.
TerrainCoin - Native Token for Angel Investing
Core Features:
Minting from Asset Accumulation:

$TerrainCoin: Minted from the assets accumulated in TerrainTreasury, specifically from the ETH/USDC balance. The minting rate is set at 1,000 TerrainCoin for every 1 ETH value in the balance, ensuring a proportional and equitable distribution.
Angel Investing Incentives:

As a native token, TerrainCoin incentivizes angel investing by offering a 20% rebate on trade fees for completed trades exceeding 10 ETH within a trading window. This unique feature encourages users to actively participate in angel investing activities, contributing to the growth of the ecosystem.
Liquidity Pool Access:

TerrainCoin provides users with access to a Liquidity Pool, allowing borrowing from a placeholder "TerrainTreasuryChest" in the form of USDC. This strategic integration empowers angel investors to support other Optimistic Superchain and Mode Network protocols while participating in the DeFi landscape.
TerrainRebate and TerrainBack Functions:

TerrainRebate incentivizes active trading by providing a 20% rebate on trade fees in TerrainCoin for trades exceeding 10 ETH. On the other hand, the TerrainBack function enables users to utilize owned TerrainCoin to cover trade fees at a 1,000 TerrainCoin to 1 ETH ratio, offering flexibility and utility to token holders.
